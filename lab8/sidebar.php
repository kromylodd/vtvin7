        <div class="sum-up" id="sum-up">
          <p>
            &nbsp;Sleep is crucial for overall health, enhancing cognitive
            function, emotional stability, and physical well-being. It supports
            a healthy immune system, reduces stress, and lowers the risk of
            chronic diseases.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;Without adequate sleep, various health issues can arise,
            making it essential to prioritize good sleep for a balanced and
            healthy life.

          <article>
            &nbsp; Sleep helps consolidate memories and information learned
            during the day, making it easier to recall and understand material
            later. Without adequate sleep, your brain struggles to retain new
            information.

            focused, which can improve your study sessions and overall
